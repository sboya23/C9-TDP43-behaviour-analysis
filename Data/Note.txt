Data and processing scripts which reproduce the statistical analysis in the paper and the individual figure pannels as tiffs.
For best results run in RStudio.

After extracting the folder, paste on your Desktop or change the working directory to the relevant one.

EPM folder - contains scripts for statistical analysis (.rmd) and plotting for C9, and TDP43, as well as raw data files (.csv) (4 files in total)

Marble burying folder - contains 4 files for analysis and plotting (.rmd) and 4 files of raw data (.csv) for each model at each time point (8 files in total)

OKD folder - contains scripts for statistical analysis and plotting for C9, and TDP43 (.rmd), as well as raw data files (.csv) (4 files in total)

Olfaction folder - contains 4 files for analysis and plotting (.rmd) and 4 files of raw data (.csv) for each model at each time point (8 files in total)

Social folder - contains scripts for statistical analysis and plotting (.rmd) for C9, and TDP43, as well as raw data files, and data for the genotypes of each mouse (.csv) (6 files in total), during preprocessing two extra files are created per model

Weight and echo-MRI folder - for each model there is a pre-processing rmd file, raw data (csv), file for the genotype and sex of each mouse (csv), and file for statistical analysis (rmd), for each model, run the preprocessing file first, once you have the final preprocessed file, ending on _n3, run the file for statistical analysis.
For echo-MRI there is one file with raw data (.csv), and one file for statistical analysis (.rmd) (10 files in total)
